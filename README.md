# Hi there, I'm Zia 👋

I'm a web developer focused on building robust, scalable applications with the **MERN stack** and **Next.js**. While I work across the full stack, my primary strength and interest lie in backend development—designing efficient APIs, managing databases, and ensuring everything runs smoothly behind the scenes.

- 💡 **Tech Stack:** MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js, Next.js
- 🛠️ **Backend Focus:** API design, database management, backend architecture
- 🧹 **Coding Philosophy:** Clean code, clear structure, and building systems that are both reliable and maintainable
- 👾 **Beyond Coding:** I enjoy tackling coding challenges and continuously learning new technologies
